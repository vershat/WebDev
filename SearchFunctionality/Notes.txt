1. Imports & State Management
Imports:
restaurantList from "../../config.js" (initial list of restaurants).
useState from React (to manage state).
RestrauntCard from "./Restraunt.js" (to display each restaurant).
State Variables:
searchText: Stores the text entered in the search bar.
restaurants: Stores the list of restaurants (starts with restaurantList).
2. filterData Function (Filtering Logic)
Takes two parameters:
searchText: User input for filtering.
restaurants: The current list of restaurants.
Uses .filter() to check if the restaurantâ€™s name includes searchText (case-insensitive).
Returns the filtered list.
3. Component UI & Functionality
Search Bar:

Input field (searchText updates as user types).
Search button (onClick triggers filtering).
Issue: The restaurants state gets permanently updated when filtering, so the original list is lost.
Fix: Store the original list separately (e.g., allRestaurants state).
Restaurant List:

Uses .map() to display restaurants.
Each restaurant is passed as props to RestrauntCard.
Uses key={restaurant.data.id} to optimize React rendering.
4. Potential Improvements
Preserve Original Data:
Introduce a new allRestaurants state to store the original list.
Update restaurants state only when searching.
Handle No Results Case:
Display a message when no restaurants match the search.
Debounce Search:
Improve performance by delaying search execution (e.g., using setTimeout).
